# web-summarizer-dotnet (AI refactored)

This is a test project for refactoring applications to another programming language using AI. The original project was developed in python.

The tool scrapes a single website or landing pages for the most important information and feeds this data into a prompt to OpenAI's GPT-4 API.

It will return short paragraphs summarizing and describing the brand/company, their products/services, and other information from the website.

## Requirements

- .NET 8.0 or higher is required.
- You need to have Chrome WebDriver installed.
- You need to have an OpenAI API key.

## Get Started

To get started, copy the `.env.template` and rename it to `.env`. Add your OpenAI credentials and custom config here (language, default file path).

Then, restore the packages with the following command:

```
dotnet restore
```

If you want to scrape local files, add the path to the file in the `.env` file and place it in the data folder.
